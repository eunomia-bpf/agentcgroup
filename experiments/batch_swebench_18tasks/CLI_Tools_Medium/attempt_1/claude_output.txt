Perfect! Let me create a summary of the fix:

## Summary

I've successfully fixed the issue where mouse move events were not being sent to the Screen object. Here's what was done:

### **The Problem**
Mouse move events (`MouseMove`) were never being posted to the Screen's message handlers. While other mouse events (`MouseDown`, `MouseUp`, `MouseScrollUp`, `MouseScrollDown`) were properly posted to the Screen when appropriate, `MouseMove` events were only being forwarded to the specific widget under the mouse cursor. This meant that Screen objects could not define an `on_mouse_move()` handler to react to mouse movement.

### **The Solution**
I added a single line to the `_forward_event()` method in `/testbed/src/textual/screen.py`:

```python
elif isinstance(event, events.MouseMove):
    event.style = self.get_style_at(event.screen_x, event.screen_y)
    self._handle_mouse_move(event)
    self.post_message(event)  # <- Added this line
```

This line posts the `MouseMove` event to the Screen's message dispatch system, allowing Screen objects to define and use `on_mouse_move()` handlers, consistent with how other mouse events are handled.

### **Testing**
- ✅ All 35 mouse-related tests pass
- ✅ All 37 screen-related tests pass  
- ✅ All 6 event-related tests pass
- ✅ **1353 total tests passed** (comprehensive test suite)
- ✅ Verified the fix works: Screen objects can now receive and handle MouseMove events
